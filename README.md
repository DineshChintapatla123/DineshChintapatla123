The purpose of this test plan is to ensure the reliability, security, and accuracy of GAIA, a transaction monitoring system that:

Processes Correspondent Banking Transactions.
Uses Neo4j and Cypher for fraud detection.
Generates Alerts and Notifications based on risk events.
Ingests transaction data from external sources like the Sigma team.
Testing will focus on functional correctness, integration, performance, and security across different system components.

2. Scope
2.1 Modules to be Tested
Transaction Ingestion

Input sources (CSV files, APIs).
Data validation (format, completeness, correctness).
Error handling (missing/incorrect data).
Transaction Processing

Storing & updating transactions.
Triggering fraud alerts & notifications.
Classifying transactions into pay events, risk events, and scenarios.
Alerts & Notifications

Verification of alert generation.
Integration with FCRM (Fraud Case Management System).
Accuracy of transaction details in notifications.
Integration Testing

Communication between GAIA and:
Neo4j (Graph-based fraud detection).
Kafka (Real-time streaming).
FCRM (Fraud management).
JWT authentication (Token validation, user roles).
Security Testing

Authentication & Authorization:
JWT token verification (issuer, audience, expiry).
Role-based access control (RBAC).
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
Data security (Encryption, access control).
Performance & Load Testing

Handling high transaction volumes (e.g., 60,000+ transactions/day).
API response time validation.
Query performance in Neo4j (Cypher queries).
3. Test Strategy
3.1 Types of Testing
Test Type	Description
Functional Testing	Validate API responses, UI behavior, and business logic.
Integration Testing	Ensure smooth data exchange between GAIA, Neo4j, Kafka, and FCRM.
Performance Testing	Test system behavior under peak loads and stress conditions.
Security Testing	Validate authentication (JWT, MFA), encryption, and access control.
Regression Testing	Ensure new changes donâ€™t break existing functionalities.
3.2 Test Data Requirements
Dummy Transactions: Simulated banking transactions for ingestion.
Fraudulent & Non-Fraudulent Data: To validate fraud detection logic.
User Roles & Permissions: Test different levels of access (admin, investigator, viewer).
3.3 Test Environments
Environment	Purpose
Dev	Test individual APIs in an isolated branch.
Test	Validate system behavior with dummy data.
UAT	End-to-end testing before production deployment.
Production	Live environment monitoring.
4. Test Execution Approach
4.1 Manual Testing
Postman / Swagger: Validate API request/response.
Neo4j Browser: Verify fraud graph generation.
4.2 Automation Testing
Rest Assured: Automate API tests.
JUnit/TestNG: Write automated functional tests.
Cucumber: For behavior-driven testing (if required).
4.3 Performance Testing
JMeter: Load testing for transaction processing.
Gatling: Simulating concurrent user behavior.
4.4 Security Testing
JWT.io: Validate token structure and claims.
Burp Suite: API security testing.
OWASP ZAP: Detect vulnerabilities.
5. Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Postman / Swagger	API testing.
Rest Assured	Automated API testing.
JMeter / Gatling	Performance testing.
Neo4j Browser	Graph database validation.
GitHub	Version control.
IntelliJ	Test development.
Docker	Containerized test environments.
6. Test Cases Overview
6.1 Ingestion Testing
Test Case	Expected Outcome
Upload a valid CSV file	Transactions should be ingested successfully.
Upload a CSV with missing fields	System should reject the file and return an error.
API-based transaction ingestion	API should process and store the transaction data.
6.2 Fraud Detection & Alerts
Test Case	Expected Outcome
Trigger a fraudulent transaction	Fraud alert should be generated.
Verify alert classification	Alert should be categorized correctly in FCRM.
Process a normal transaction	No fraud alert should be triggered.
6.3 Security Tests
Test Case	Expected Outcome
Use an expired JWT token	API should reject the request.
Attempt unauthorized access	System should deny access.
Test MFA authentication	Users should be prompted for a second factor.
7. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
High transaction volume may cause performance issues	Conduct load testing & optimize queries.
API security vulnerabilities	Implement JWT validation & penetration testing.
Integration failures with Neo4j, Kafka, or FCRM	Ensure proper error handling & logging.
8. Conclusion
This consolidated test plan provides a structured approach to ensuring Application X (GAIA) meets all functional, security, and performance requirements. The next steps involve:

Creating detailed test cases based on this plan.
Setting up test environments (Dev, Test, UAT).
Executing manual & automated tests.
Reporting defects & improving test coverage.
