1. Understanding the System
Application X (GAIA) is a fraud detection and transaction monitoring system that:

Processes Correspondent Banking Transactions.
Uses Neo4j and Cypher for graph-based fraud detection.
Generates Alerts and Notifications via FCRM.
Ingests transaction data from external sources (e.g., CSV files from the Sigma team).
2. Testing Strategy
2.1 Ingestion Testing
Input sources: CSV files (received on the 5th of every month).
Validation points:
Check if the data is ingested correctly.
Ensure format correctness (required fields, data types).
Validate error handling (missing fields, incorrect values).
Tools: Postman, Swagger (manual API testing), Rest Assured (automation).
2.2 Functional Testing
Key Processes to Test:
Registration of transactions.
Storage & Ingestion into the system.
Updating transaction records.
Validation:
API responses (sample request, response, headers).
Ensure that alerts and notifications are triggered for suspicious transactions.
2.3 Integration Testing
Verify API communication with:
FCRM (Fraud Case Management System).
Kafka (real-time transaction streaming).
Neo4j (graph database for fraud detection).
Validation:
Check if transactions flow correctly between systems.
Ensure that generated fraud alerts are sent correctly to FCRM.
2.4 Performance Testing
Validate system stability under high transaction volumes:
Test ingestion for 60,000+ transactions/day.
Measure API response times.
Identify bottlenecks in database queries (Cypher queries in Neo4j).
2.5 Security Testing
Authentication & Authorization:
Validate JWT tokens (issuer, audience, expiry).
Test role-based access control (RBAC).
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) testing.
Verify data security (encryption, access control).
3. Test Execution Approach
Dev Branch â†’ Test API endpoints in an isolated environment.
Test Environment â†’ Load dummy transaction data & verify if fraud graphs are generated.
UAT & Production â†’ Final validation before deployment.
4. Tools
Postman / Swagger â†’ API testing.
Rest Assured â†’ Automation.
GitHub â†’ Version control.
IntelliJ â†’ Development & test execution.
Docker â†’ Containerized test environments.
5. Next Steps
Set up a test plan covering all critical transactions and scenarios.
Implement automated API tests for key endpoints.
Work with the Sigma team to validate real transaction data.
Ensure fraud alerts are being classified correctly in FCRM.

Based on the notes from the images and the details discussed, hereâ€™s a consolidated test plan for Application X (GAIA - Transaction Monitoring System):

Test Plan for Application X (GAIA - Transaction Monitoring System)
1. Introduction
1.1 Objective
The purpose of this test plan is to ensure the reliability, security, and accuracy of GAIA, a transaction monitoring system that:

Processes Correspondent Banking Transactions.
Uses Neo4j and Cypher for fraud detection.
Generates Alerts and Notifications based on risk events.
Ingests transaction data from external sources like the Sigma team.
Testing will focus on functional correctness, integration, performance, and security across different system components.

2. Scope
2.1 Modules to be Tested
Transaction Ingestion

Input sources (CSV files, APIs).
Data validation (format, completeness, correctness).
Error handling (missing/incorrect data).
Transaction Processing

Storing & updating transactions.
Triggering fraud alerts & notifications.
Classifying transactions into pay events, risk events, and scenarios.
Alerts & Notifications

Verification of alert generation.
Integration with FCRM (Fraud Case Management System).
Accuracy of transaction details in notifications.
Integration Testing

Communication between GAIA and:
Neo4j (Graph-based fraud detection).
Kafka (Real-time streaming).
FCRM (Fraud management).
JWT authentication (Token validation, user roles).
Security Testing

Authentication & Authorization:
JWT token verification (issuer, audience, expiry).
Role-based access control (RBAC).
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
Data security (Encryption, access control).
Performance & Load Testing
